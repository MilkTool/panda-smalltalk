Some random scribblings about the project.



Departures from Smalltalk-80:

1)
Array literals have been replaced by Tuple literals. Unlike Array literals
which are limited to containing compile-time constants, Tuples can contain variables.


2)
Removed notion of `variable{Byte,Float,Word}Subclass:' class definitions.
Can only use `subclass:' to create new definitions. 

Arrayed objects cannot have instance variables (because it simplifies the object model and VM)

instances of Array, ByteArray, FloatArray are regarded as magic to the VM and are treated differently
from normal objects. These Arrayed types can be subclassed, but no instvars can be added.

CompiledMethods are now ordinary objects containing arrayed `bytecode' and 'literals' instvars

3)
Threads must die!

They are a usability nightmare. They are hard to use. They break encapsulation. 
They introduce non-deterministic behaviour. Locks can cause performance problems.

Just say no!

Need to implement Concurrency somewhere along the lines of Erlang.

Erlang's message-passing idiom can map well to Smalltalk. This is an advantage.


4)
Objects can be immutable.


5)
Renamed Magnitude to Comparable

6)
Renamed LinkedList to List
