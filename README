Panda is a new Smalltalk implementation, written from scratch in C99. Its still
in early development, certainly not suitable for production use.

Current features:
* All Smalltalk-80 syntax supported.
* Fast bytecode interpreter (optionally uses gcc's computed goto)
* Mark-Compact garbage collector
* Includes a small class library

Next Milestone:
* Full Closures
* Allocating contexts on the stack rather than the heap.
* Image
* Finish Stream and IO classes
* WeakRef/Finalization support

Usage: 
The main executable `panda', reads Smalltalk statements from stdin, interprets
them and outputs the result of the last statement. Variables can be declared
in the usual Smalltalk way.
